/*
A string is called prime if it can not be constructed by 
concatenating multiple equal strings.

For example: 
"abac" is prime, but "xyxy" is not prime because 
"xy" + "xy" == "xyxy"

Implement a program that outputs whether a string is prime.

For example: 
"xyxy" is not prime
"aaaa" is not prime
"hello" is prime
