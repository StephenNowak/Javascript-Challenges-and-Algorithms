/*
Create a program that takes 3 inputs, a lower bound,
an upper bound, and the expression. Calculate the sum of
that range based on the given expression and output the 
result. 

For example: 
input: 2 4*2
output: 18 (2*2 + 3*2 + 4*2)

input:1 5%2
output: 3 (1%2 + 2%2 + 3%2 + 4%2 + 5%2)
