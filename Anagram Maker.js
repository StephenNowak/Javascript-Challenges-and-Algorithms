/*
Given an array of strings, please write a method (or more than one if you would like) 
which takes in the array as a parameter and logs each matching set of anagrams to the 
console on a new line — for example, with the word list “act”, “cat”, “spot”, “tops”, 
“pots”, “jump” you might output the following: act, cat, spot, tops, pots
Here is a word list for testing:
var words = [‘map’, ‘art’, ‘how’, ‘rat’, ‘tar’, ‘who’, ‘pam’, ‘shoop’];
