/*
Golbach's Conjecture is a rule in math that states the following:
every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

Write a program that finds every possible pair of prime numbers, whose sum equals
the given number or a set of numbers within a range.

For example: 
input:16
output:3+13 & 5+11

input:32
output:3+29 & 13+19

input:4, 8
output:
4: 2+2
6: 3+3
8: 3+5
