/*
A lab number is a number such that the square of any of its prime numbers
is still one of its divisors.

For example:
input:8
output:true (2 is a prime divisor of 8, and 2*2=4 is also a divisor of 8)

input:50
output:true (5 is a prime divisor of 50, and 5*5=25 is also a divisor of 50)

Write a program to check if the user input is a Lab number. Return true or false.
