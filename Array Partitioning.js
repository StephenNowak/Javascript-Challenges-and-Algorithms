/*
Divide a given array of numbers into two subarrays such that the 
absolute difference between their sums is the smallest possible. 
For example, the array [2, 5, 4, 7, 15, 20] can be divided into 
subarrays [15, 7, 4] and [20, 5, 2]. The sum of the first array is 
26 and the sum of the 2nd array is 27. The difference between the 
sums of those arrays is 1, and it is the smallest.
